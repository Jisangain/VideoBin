# VideoBin
A Flask-based platform for sharing videos with direct links, similar to Pastebin but for video content. It offers customizable web advertisements, allowing video publishers and site managers to manage ad placement and monetization. Videos are stored locally, with an option to use external storage like Catbox for servers with limited space.
